Simple example: an Agent might not have the inherent capability to reliably perform mathematical calculations by itself. However, we can introduce an expert - in this case a calculator, an expert at mathematical calculations. Now, when we need to perform a calculation, the Agent can call in the expert rather than trying to predict the result itself.

    "> This is one definition of an agent: an agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. Unlike a chain, an agent gives an LLM some degree of control over the sequence of steps in the application. Examples of using an LLM to decide the control of an application:\n",

    "[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) gives the developer a high degree of control by expressing the flow of the application as a set of nodes and edges. All nodes can access and modify a common state (memory). The control flow of the application can set using edges that connect nodes, either deterministically or via conditional logic.\n",
